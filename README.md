# Typological Analysis of the Morphological Evolution of Buddhist Architecture in Southeastern Shanxi Province
This is the dissertation project of my BArch degree. I analyzed the typological classification of Jindongnan Buddhist architecture based on the 200 instances collected by field measurement and drone photographing and the 2106 instances recorded in official illustrations. <br> <br>
I introduced the concept of "Formal Sequence" in George Kubler's 1962 work "_The Shape of Time_" to the study, and considered the morphological evolution of Buddhist architecture as the consequence of consistent, dynamic response to its ever-changing semantic role in the larger community context. During the analysis, however, I found it very hard to quantitatively define and represent the "context". This is crucial to my study. Let's take an example to explain it:<br><br>
The downscaling of Buddhist temples in rural areas is observed temporally accompanying the rapid secularization of Buddhist rituals. The reasonable guess is that as Shamans involved themselves continuously more intensively in the daily affairs of villagers, like marriages, funerals, festivals, schooling and financing, the site of temples must have moved closer to the community center. But how can we prove this hypothesis? We need a well-defined measurement of "closeness".
